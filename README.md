## Introduction

Nixus Device System is a cross-platform terminal setup project aimed at
providing a consistent and powerful environment across various devices and
operating systems. By leveraging Nix and related technologies, we offer
system-level integration, secret management, VPN solutions, and more for a
seamless experience across desktop and mobile platforms, as well as standalone
Home Manager configurations.

  environment management
- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/): Full system-level integration
- [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin): macOS system-level
  integration
- [Nix-on-Droid](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-on-droid): Android
  integration (aarch64-linux only)
- [Mobile NixOS](https://github.com/mobile-nixos/mobile-nixos): Experimental
  mobile device support

### Feature Descriptions

- **System-level integration**: Ensures deep integration with the host operating
  system for optimal performance and functionality. Not applicable for
  standalone Home Manager use.
- **Secret management**: Utilizes sops-nix for secure handling of sensitive
  information across platforms, including standalone Home Manager
  configurations.
- **VPN solutions**: Implements Tailscale for secure networking, with WireGuard
  support planned for the future. Available in Home Manager configurations.
- **Distributed clipboard registry**: A work-in-progress feature for seamless
  clipboard sharing between devices, including Home Manager setups.
- **GPG/YubiKey support**: Planned security enhancements for robust
  authentication and encryption capabilities across all supported platforms.

## Installation

path/to/bootstrap' $ nix run .#deploy --
'github:geoffreygarrett/nix-on-droid/main' 'user@host:/path/to/bootstrap'

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

(Add installation instructions for each supported platform, including standalone
Home Manager use)
